    <h2>Why Credit Cards Matter for Cash Flow</h2>
    <p>Business card usage does more than simplify payments — it affects liquidity. Every transaction interacts with a billing cycle, a settlement date and the company’s cash reserves.</p>
    <p>The gap between when a purchase is made and when the statement is due creates “float”: temporary access to credit that companies can use for short-term operations or to maintain liquidity.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="mechanics" class="section">
    <h2>How Float, Settlement and Cycles Work</h2>
    <p>Every credit card has a structured billing cycle. Purchases accumulate, a statement closes, and the company has a fixed number of days before payment is due. This time window creates predictable, recurring liquidity.</p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Float period</strong> – the time between purchase and statement payment.</li>
      <li><strong>Cycle timing</strong> – influences how many days of liquidity each purchase provides.</li>
      <li><strong>Settlement mechanics</strong> – merchants are paid immediately, but the business pays later.</li>
      <li><strong>Cash-flow smoothing</strong> – predictable cycles help manage operational volatility.</li>
      <li><strong>Rewards vs. cost</strong> – rewards matter, but cash-flow timing often matters more.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>The Role of Cards in Working Capital Strategy</h2>
    <p>Working capital is the money available for day-to-day operations. Credit cards can influence this by temporarily reducing the cash needed to fund purchases.</p>
    <p>Used responsibly, float can support inventory cycles, travel costs, software payments or advertising spend — especially for small and mid-sized businesses with tight liquidity windows.</p>
    <p>However, over-reliance on credit can also mask deeper cash-flow issues, which is why clear internal policies remain essential.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Billing, Limits and Risk Controls</h2>
    <p>Cycle timing, credit limits and repayment structures all affect how much working capital a business can “unlock” through cards.</p>
    <p>Issuers may offer higher limits based on revenue, turnover or financial statements. Strong controls reduce risk: purchase limits, merchant category restrictions, and spending reviews.</p>
